/**
 * One messaging gateway per Hermes profile that has a channel to answer on.
 *
 * The hub supervises one `hermes gateway run` against Hermes's root home (`hermes-runtime.ts`),
 * and that process serves **the default profile only**: Hermes scopes a gateway to one profile
 * (`hermes_cli/profiles.py` §profiles_to_serve — exactly the active profile unless
 * `gateway.multiplex_profiles` is on). A WhatsApp paired in profile «manger» is written to
 * `profiles/manger/`, and nothing served it: messages to the number went unanswered
 * (the owner's report of 2026-09-24).
 *
 * So each named profile with at least one channel switched on and able to sign in
 * (`channels.ts` §activeChannels) **or at least one active scheduled job of Hermes's own**
 * (`activeCronJobs`) gets its own `hermes -p <profile> gateway run`, supervised the way the
 * default one is: restarted with backoff when it dies, its lines in the hub's log with the
 * profile's name, stopped with the hub. A profile with neither gets none — each is a Python
 * process of about 200 MB.
 *
 * Why scheduled jobs: Hermes keeps a profile's jobs in that profile's own `cron/jobs.json` and
 * only a gateway scoped to that profile fires them (`cron/jobs.py`: "a profile-scoped gateway
 * runs that profile's jobs under that same HERMES_HOME"). A job an agent scheduled in «manger»
 * never ran while «manger» had no gateway. Jobs change without the hub — an agent schedules one
 * in a chat, a person runs `hermes cron` — so the set is checked again every half minute too,
 * the interval Hermes's own multiplexer rescans at.
 *
 * Hermes's kanban has one board for every profile and one dispatcher for it. A gateway runs
 * the dispatcher unless told not to, and the first gateway to take its lock keeps it, so a
 * profile gateway started first would dispatch every profile's cards in its own environment.
 * Profile gateways are started with `HERMES_KANBAN_DISPATCH_IN_GATEWAY=false`; the default
 * gateway stays the one dispatcher (`gateway/kanban_watchers.py` §_kanban_dispatcher_boot).
 *
 * Why a process per profile and not Hermes's multiplexer (one gateway serving every profile):
 * under the multiplexer `os.environ` is process-wide and first-writer-wins, so a profile's own
 * `.env` keys cannot differ from the default's, which is the direction of the providers work
 * (shared providers plus a profile's own keys in its own `.env`). A process per profile is
 * Hermes's historical mode and keeps every profile's environment its own.
 *
 * What two gateways side by side must not share, read from Hermes's MIT source (v2026.9.14):
 * - the pid, lock and state files and the control socket live in the profile's home
 *   (`gateway/status.py`, `gateway/control_socket.py`), so they never meet;
 * - the API server binds 8642 when `API_SERVER_KEY` is in the environment
 *   (`gateway/config_env.py` §_api_server). Only the default gateway gets it — the hub talks to
 *   that one alone — and the key is left out of every other one's environment;
 * - the WhatsApp bridge listens on 3000 unless the profile says otherwise, and a second bridge
 *   on the same port adopts or kills the first (`channels.ts` §ensureWhatsAppBridgePort), so a
 *   named profile's bridge is given a port of its own before its gateway starts;
 * - a platform identity (a bot token, a WhatsApp session) is locked machine-wide by its
 *   identity, so one identity in two profiles is refused by Hermes itself, in its words.
 *
 * Keys reach a profile gateway the way they reach every Hermes process the hub starts: the
 * shared provider environment (ADR 0010), with the profile's own `.env` read by Hermes over it.
 * Before each start the models module writes the hub's endpoints and the profile's model into
 * the profile's `config.yaml` (`prepare`), so the gateway resolves the same providers a chat in
 * that profile does.
 *
 * ── One gateway per host (Hermes v2026.9.21, `0.21.4`, and later) ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything above is the **per-profile** topology, kept exactly as it was for an older Hermes.
 * From v2026.9.21 Hermes allows one `hermes gateway run` per host (per OS user) and makes it
 * serve every profile (`gateway/host_attach.py`, `hermes_cli/gateway_multiplex_mode.py`): a
 * second gateway asks the first whether it serves its profile and, when it does, prints "One
 * gateway per host serves every profile; manage it with `hermes -p default gateway restart`"
 * and exits 75 — so a per-profile gateway the hub started only ever crash-looped. Read from the
 * MIT source of v2026.9.21 and v2026.9.24:
 * - the gateway started first multiplexes unless only one profile exists or another profile
 *   still runs its own gateway (`implicit_multiplex_blocker`); it writes the profiles it serves
 *   to its `gateway_state.json` (`served_profiles`: every one when it multiplexes, `[]` when it
 *   does not) and each served profile's platforms there as `<profile>:<platform>`;
 * - a served profile's secrets are no longer process-wide: each turn runs under that profile's
 *   own `.env` through a secret scope, without touching `os.environ` (`_profile_runtime_scope`),
 *   so the old reason for a process per profile is gone;
 * - its scheduler fires the jobs of **every** profile whether or not it multiplexes
 *   (`_cron_tick_profile_homes`), and it is the one kanban dispatcher and the one API server;
 * - it rebuilds a served profile whose `config.yaml` or `.env` changed, and starts serving a new
 *   profile, every 30 s or at once on its control socket's `rescan-profiles`
 *   (`gateway/run_profile_reconcile.py`, `hermes-control.ts`); whether it multiplexes at all is
 *   decided when it starts, so a root gateway that came up alone is restarted to serve more;
 * - the host lock lives per OS user, not per home (`gateway/host_rendezvous.py`), which is why
 *   the root gateway of a hub beside a person's own Hermes gets a lock folder of its own
 *   (`hermes-runtime.ts` §gatewayLockEnv);
 * - Hermes itself does not yet run a named profile's WhatsApp under the multiplexer (it marks it
 *   `multiplex_shared_ingress`); the card shows Hermes's own reason.
 *
 * So once this Hermes is known to run one gateway per host — its version, or a gateway that
 * exited 75 saying so — the hub starts no profile gateway: the root one (`hermes-runtime.ts`)
 * serves every profile, each named profile's row on the card follows it, and a channel change
 * in a named profile asks it to rescan (or restarts it when it does not multiplex yet).
